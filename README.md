# TODO: Finish this README

## Rough overview

This is an educational 3D vectors sandbox I made to fill the void of easy to use tools to learn vectors and planes in 3D. I originally came up with the idea as an attempt to help students visualize what 3D vectors look like during COVID-19. 3D vectors were already a difficult concept for students to wrap their heads around in my senior year, so I'm hoping that a tool like this can aid in some of those difficulties.

It was created _mainly_ using **React, Three.js, and Typescript**.
